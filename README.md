# Discrete Harmonic Function and Dirichlet's Relaxation Process 

The goal of this project is to create interactiveMathematica-based visualizations of interesting mathematical topics for use in instruction and outreach activities. In particular, this project focuses on visualizations illustrating discretized harmonic functions, Dirichlet problem, Dirichlet enegry, and Dirichlet's relaxation process.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. 

### Prerequisites

* This project is based on [**Mathematica**](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) programming language, which requires install the software and run the programm in a notebook format.
* If you want to run this program in a Text-Based-Interface, you can install [*WolframScript*](https://www.wolfram.com/wolframscript/).

### Installing

* 
```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Deployment
