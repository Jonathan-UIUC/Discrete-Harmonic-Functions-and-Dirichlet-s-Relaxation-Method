# Discrete Harmonic Function and Dirichlet's Relaxation Process 

The goal of this project is to create interactive Mathematica-based visualizations of interesting mathematical topics for use in instruction and outreach activities. In particular, this project focuses on visualizations illustrating discretized harmonic functions, Dirichlet problem, Dirichlet energy, and Dirichlet's relaxation process. This project is reviewed and published at [Wolfram Demonstrations Project](placeholder). This project is based on an undergraduate research project at the [Illinois Geometry Lab](https://math.illinois.edu/research/igl) and directed by [A.J. Hildebrand](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~hildebr/).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. In this repository, I include two different versions of the same software 
(*DiscreteHarmonicFunctionsDemonstrations.nb* and *DiscreteHarmonicFunctionsDemonstrations.m*). *DiscreteHarmonicFunctionsDemonstrations.m* is simply the source code of the *DiscreteHarmonicFunctionsDemonstrations.nb*. 

### Prerequisites

* This project is based on [**Mathematica**](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) programming language, which requires to install the software and run the program in a notebook format. Once downloaded, you can simply run the program by double clicking the [DiscreteHarmonicFunctionsDemonstrations.nb](DiscreteHarmonicFunctionsDemonstrations.nb) file. If you double click this file without Mathematcia installed, it will show up garbage code but you can still view the source code by double clicking the [DiscreteHarmonicFunctionsDemonstrations.m](DiscreteHarmonicFunctionsDemonstrations.m) file.

* (Optional) Good text editor.

### Installing

1. Download [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/trial/)

2. Open up terminal and direct to desire directory to clone this project. 

3. In that directory, clone this repository into your own machine by typing in the following command in termial:
```
git clone https://github.com/Jonathan-UIUC/Discrete-Harmonic-Functions-and-Dirichlet-s-Relaxation-Method.git
```

4. A new folder should appear in that directory and you can open up the folder by typing:

```
open Discrete-Harmonic-Functions-and-Dirichlet-s-Relaxation-Method
```

4.  double click the file [DiscreteHarmonicFunctionsDemonstrations.nb](DiscreteHarmonicFunctionsDemonstrations.nb) and enjoy the demosntration. :)
