# Discrete Harmonic Function and Dirichlet's Relaxation Process 

The goal of this project is to create interactive Mathematica-based visualizations of interesting mathematical topics for use in instruction and outreach activities. In particular, this project focuses on visualizations illustrating discretized harmonic functions, Dirichlet problem, Dirichlet energy, and Dirichlet's relaxation process. This project is reviewed and published at [Wolfram Demonstrations Project](placeholder). This project is based on an undergraduate research project at the [Illinois Geometry Lab](https://math.illinois.edu/research/igl) and directed by [A.J. Hildebrand](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~hildebr/).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. In this repository, I include two different versions of the same software (*DiscreteHarmonicFunctionsDemonstrations.nb* and *DiscreteHarmonicFunctionsDemonstrations.m*). *DiscreteHarmonicFunctionsDemonstrations.m* is simply the source code of the notebook version. 

### Prerequisites

* This project is based on [**Mathematica**](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) programming language, which requires install the software and run the program in a notebook format. Once downloaded, you can simply run the program by double clicking the [DiscreteHarmonicFunctionsDemonstrations.nb](DiscreteHarmonicFunctionsDemonstrations.nb) file.

### Installing

1. Download [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/trial/)

2. Clone this repository into your own machine by openning up the terminal and type in the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Jonathan-UIUC/Discrete-Harmonic-Functions-and-Dirichlet-s-Relaxation-Method.git
```

3.  double click the file [DiscreteHarmonicFunctionsDemonstrations.nb](DiscreteHarmonicFunctionsDemonstrations.nb)
